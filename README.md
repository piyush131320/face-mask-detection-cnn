# 😷 Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a Deep Learning-based Face Mask Detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.

The system can be used in real-time surveillance environments such as hospitals, airports, public places, and workplaces to ensure safety compliance.
